Attached are the .stl (MakerBot 3D printer format) and Autodesk Fusion 360
CAD files for the rack.

Description from my Lab 7 report:

*To give us better steering control with virtually no hysteresis, we
designed a rack-and-pinion steering system for the front servo that we
implemented alongside our differential drive system. The rack was 3D
printed and the .stl file has been included in our code submission. Note
that for the best results on a MakerBot Dual Replicator, the rack should be
oriented flat, with the teeth facing up and the curved side to the back of
the printer. We used 25% infill and ran the printer at 50% speed until we
reached the teeth, at which point we switched to 25% speed. We printed the
rack out of ABS, so the extruder was at 240 degrees Celsius and the printer
plate was at 110 degrees Celsius. The gear we used to mesh with the rack is
a 16-tooth high-torque servo gear, ServoCity part number 615278. It can be
found at the following link for $14.99 plus

UPDATE 4/27/18:
We've included the .stl file for the gear as well. It can be 3D
printed at 25% speed. Thanks to David Schwarz and Manish Reddy for the
file!
