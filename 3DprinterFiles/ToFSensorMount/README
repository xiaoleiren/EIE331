Feel free to use this part that I created for mounting the laser
sensors on the front of the vehicle. The outermost are angled at 45
degrees from center, inner two at 30 degrees from center. To mount
sensors either drill a hole through the plastic or heat up a nail to
melt a hole. I recommend the latter. The file with the gcode extension
is ready to just be dropped onto a flash drive and print on the
makerspace's 3D printers. The SolidWorks part is included if want to
make any modifications. (Like adding mounting holes).
