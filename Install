Keil 5 Installation

example code has been tested Keil uVision IDE version 5.38a, and we are writing software in C99. Any version of 5.xx should be ok. These programs only run on Windows 10 or 11. 

There is a way to install software on older Macintosh computers so Windows and its applications will run on the Macintosh, see running Keil and TExaS on a Macintosh. However, there is no solution to running Keil on the new Macintosh computers with the M1/M2/M3 processor, because there are no OS drivers for the Stellaris ICDI debugger. 
Macintosh users with the M1 processor can write software on CCS. We are sorry, but there are no solutions for Linux. The Keil application does not require a serial number or license key. Installing both Keil uVision 4.74 and Keil uVision 5.38 on the same computer is possible.
Step 1) How to install Keil uVision for the ARM, MDK-Lite (32KB) Edition. Go to https://www.keil.com/demo/eval/arm.htm. Enter your contact information with valid address, phone and email. Set your Company to the University of Texas at Austin. Set your devices to the Texas Instruments (TI) and Cortex-M4. Fill in all fields of this form. It should not cost any money, and you can select or not select whether you want email from ARM. ARM does provide support for Keil via its ARM University. So if you have any Keil-specific questions you could register and post them at http://www.arm.com/university/
Step 2) Right-click on MDK538A.EXE and download this 887M file to your computer.
Step 3) Execute the MDK538A.EXE file, installing the application in some place easy to find, like C:\Keil or D:\Keil. 
You will need to find the Keil directory because the TExaS example files will be loaded into this same directory. After you have run the MDK538A.EXE installer, you will not need this file. However, you can use this file to install Keil on additional computers.
