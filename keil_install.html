<h1><strong>Keil 5 Installation</strong></h1>

<p>Example code has been tested <strong>Keil uVision IDE version 5.40</strong>, and we are writing software in <strong>C99</strong>. Any version of <strong>5.xx</strong> should be ok. These programs only run on <strong>Windows 10 or 11</strong>.</p>

<p>There is a way to install software on older <strong>Macintosh</strong> computers so Windows and its applications will run on the Macintosh, see running <strong>Keil and TExaS on a Macintosh</strong>. However, there is no solution to running Keil on the new Macintosh computers with the <strong>M1/M2/M3 processor</strong>, because there are no OS drivers for the <strong>Stellaris ICDI debugger</strong>. Macintosh users with the <strong>M1 processor</strong> can write software on <strong>CCS</strong>. We are sorry, but there are no solutions for <strong>Linux</strong>. The <strong>Keil application</strong> does not require a serial number or license key. Installing both <strong>Keil uVision 4.74</strong> and <strong>Keil uVision 5.40</strong> on the same computer is possible.</p>

<h2><strong>Step 1)</strong> How to install <strong>Keil uVision</strong> for the <strong>ARM, MDK-Lite (32KB) Edition</strong>.</h2>
<p>Go to <a href="https://www.keil.com/demo/eval/arm.htm"><strong>https://www.keil.com/demo/eval/arm.htm</strong></a>. Enter your contact information with a valid address, phone, and email.</p>
<p>Set your Company to the <strong>Macau University of Science and Technology</strong>. Set your devices to the <strong>TI and Cortex-M4</strong>. Fill in all fields of this form. It should not cost any money, and you can select or not select whether you want email from <strong>ARM</strong>. <strong>ARM</strong> does provide support for <strong>Keil</strong> via its <strong>ARM University</strong>.</p>
<p>So if you have any Keil-specific questions you could register and post them at <a href="http://www.arm.com/university/"><strong>http://www.arm.com/university/</strong></a></p>

<h2><strong>Step 2)</strong> Right-click on <strong>MDK540.EXE</strong> and download this <strong>8xx M</strong> file to your computer.</h2>

<h2><strong>Step 3)</strong> Execute the <strong>MDK540.EXE</strong> file, installing the application in some place that is easy to find, like <strong>C:\Keil</strong> or <strong>D:\Keil</strong>.</h2>
<p>You will need to find the <strong>Keil directory</strong> because the <strong>TExaS example files</strong> will be loaded into this same directory. After you have run the <strong>MDK538A.EXE installer</strong>, you will not need this file. However, you can use this file to install Keil on additional computers.</p>

<p>将 <code>URL_OF_YOUR_IMAGE</code> 替换为图片的实际链接，并修改 <code>alt</code> 属性描述和宽度为合适的值。</p>
